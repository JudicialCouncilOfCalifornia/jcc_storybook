# Imposter

The Imposter element allows you to centrally position an element over the viewport, document, or a positioned element. 

You can use fixed positioning on the imposter to create a full screen modal. 

A note about flow: If using position fixed, its best to place your imposter element at the end of the document so it appears above other elements without requiring z-index.
