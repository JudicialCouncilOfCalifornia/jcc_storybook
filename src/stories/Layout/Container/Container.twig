<div {{ attributes.addClass(classes) }}>
  <p>The `.container` class has the job of ensuring it's content doesn't expand beyond a maximum width when the screen size is very wide. It expands as wide as it can up to a `max-inline-size` as defined by `--max-width`. There it provides auto `margin-inline` to center it.</p>
  <p>This is similar to the Center layout, but the center layout is responsible for maintaining a proper "measure" or maximum comfortable line length for reading text. The Container is the outer element that prevents all internal elements from spreading out to infinity as the device permits.</p>
  <p>Usually the only things that exist outside of a Container are things that provide backgrounds or media that are meant to go all the way to the edge of the screen.</p>
  <p>When the screen width is narrower than the `--max-width` imposed by the Container, it's like the Container is not even there. It provides no margin or padding on it's own. See the <strong>Box</strong> Docs for more on "separation of concerns".</p>
