<!-- Markdown description for Brow -->

The Brow is often placed above headings. There are two possible parts, which are styled differently. The colors of each part of the brow can be inherited from an ancestor component (i.e. Section) via CSS variables.

  - `--accent-color` brow part one.
  - `--color` brow part two and borders on the `.brow--heading` variant.

Controlling Variables: 

  - **variant**: [default | heading]
