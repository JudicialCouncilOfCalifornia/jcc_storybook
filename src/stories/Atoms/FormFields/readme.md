# Form Fields

Form fields is a work in progress. We can add to it as we find representations of various fields in the designs.

The goal is to just be a style guide for form elements and the CSS from this component will go into the global CSS so it's available to all components that include form elements, or any forms passed in from the CMS.

One way to approach styling these form elements are to copy the CMS's default output for an item and remove accessory classes and data attributes, and simplify it down to the basic classes and structure.
