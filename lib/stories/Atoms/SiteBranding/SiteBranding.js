/**
 * Site Branding behavior.
 *
 * DELETE THIS FILE IF IT'S NOT NEEDED
 * REMEMBER TO ALSO REMOVE THE import FROM SiteBranding.stories.js
 *
 * Remember jQuery is deprecated. Go vanilla!
 * This will be wrapped in Drupal.behaviors on build, so no need for that here.
 * Just write plain old Javascript.
